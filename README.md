# Hi, I’m Corey 👋

I’m an **Applied AI & Solutions Engineer** bridging **AI R&D**, **systems integration**, and **end-to-end deployment**. With 9+ years of enterprise application support experience, I specialize in building **secure, high-performance AI systems** that modernize IT operations, accelerate service delivery, and operate in compliance-sensitive environments.

I hold an active **CJIS clearance** and am currently deploying **NotebookLM** and **RAG chatbot** solutions while completing my **B.S. in Artificial Intelligence** (4.0 GPA).

---

## 🎯 Current Technical Focus
- **Deploying AI Knowledge Management Systems** that process 2,000+ documents for instant, cited answers.
- **Developing RAG chatbot architectures** with vector databases, scheduled ingestion, and prompt catalogs.
- **Prototyping ITSM AI copilots** with human-in-the-loop approval, field pre-fill, and ticket triage automation.
- **Fine-tuning LLMs** (Mistral 7B, Gemma, Llama 3) via QLoRA for domain-specific enterprise use cases.
- **Building automation infrastructure** on Raspberry Pi and Mac Mini for persistent, edge-based AI workflows.
- **Planning and building a home lab** — converting existing hardware into a rack-based system, swapping the PC case to a server case, and setting up a dedicated home lab rack for scalable AI and automation experimentation.
